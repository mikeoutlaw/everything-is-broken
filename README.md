# Widget Co
## Overview
This is a game that was developed during Coding Blocks' first game jam (aka #cbjam). Here's the idea of this game:

* Based on the idea/premise of the Universal Paperclips or Cookie Clicker games.
* The premise will center around our heroine's, Michelle, new start-up company called Widget Co.
* Like most start ups, Widget Co's software has a lot to be written, so we've gotta close tickets!
* The more developers we hire, the more tickets we can close. Maybe?
* We'll differeniate between bug tickets (less effort, lower value) and new feature tickets (more difficult, more valuable).

## TODO
* Use the Idle Game Maker engine: https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/
* Introduce ticket differeniation
* Maybe Docker-ize?
* Maybe Kubernetes-ize?
* Maybe Skaffold-ize?

## Game Add-ons
Defaults to single developer.
* Additional devs (cheapest, but less efficient)
* Add a team of devs (cost a little more, but more productive)
* Add unit tests (increases productivity)
* Add TDD (includes productivity more than just unit tests)
* Automate local dev env using Docker/K8s/etc (increases developer productivity)
* Offer free lunch (costs but improves developer health, reduces away time, encourages more conversations, increases productivity)
* Expand into new office/building/city to increase throughput

## Scoring Breakdown
* Individual Contributor - 1 ticket/second
* Small Team - 1 ticket/500ms
* Medium Team - 5 tickets per every 2 seconds
